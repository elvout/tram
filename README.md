## Updates
- [2025/02] Update with better gravity & floor prediction. Add EMDB evaluation.
- [2024/04] Initial release.

## Installation
0. Be in a CUDA development environment (this fork targets CUDA 12.4).
1. Clone this repo with the `--recursive` flag.
```Bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yufu-wang/tram
# If you have already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
2. Creating and activate a new virtual environment.
```Bash
# Creates the virtual environment if it does not exist already.
# This will take several minutes to install packages.
bash install.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Compile DROID-SLAM. If you encountered difficulty in this step, please refer to its [official release](https://github.com/princeton-vl/DROID-SLAM) for more info. In this project, DROID is modified to support masking.
```Bash
cd thirdparty/DROID-SLAM
python setup.py install
cd ../..
```

## Prepare data
Register at [SMPLify](https://smplify.is.tue.mpg.de) and [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de), whose usernames and passwords will be used by our script to download the SMPL models. In addition, we will fetch trained checkpoints and an example video. Note that thirdparty models have their own licenses.

Run the following to fetch all models and checkpoints to `data/`. It also downloads `example_video.mov` for the demo.
```Bash
bash scripts/download_models.sh
```

## Run demo on videos
This project integrates the complete 4D human system, including tracking, slam, and 4D human capture in the world space. We separate the core functionalities into different scripts, which should be run **sequentially**. Each step will save its result to be used by the next step. All results will be saved in a folder with the same name as the video.

```bash
# 1. Run Masked Droid SLAM (also detect+track humans in this step)
python scripts/estimate_camera.py --video "./example_video.mov"
# -- You can indicate if the camera is static. The algorithm will try to catch it as well.
python scripts/estimate_camera.py --video "./another_video.mov" --static_camera

# 2. Run 4D human capture with VIMO.
python scripts/estimate_humans.py --video "./example_video.mov"

# 3. Put everything together. Render the output video.
python scripts/visualize_tram.py --video "./example_video.mov"
```

Running the above three scripts on the provided video `./example_video.mov` will create a folder `./results/exapmle_video` and save all results in it. Please see available arguments in the scripts.


## Evaluation
You can run inference and evaluation from scratch on EMDB as follow.

```bash
# Inference and evaluation (saves results in "results/emdb")
bash scripts/emdb/run.sh
```

You can also download our saved results [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ghLfoFpaoi1SHnYJSM1iaOFzetwLkHD8?usp=sharing), skipping the inference, and run evaluation directly as follow.
```bash
# Evaluation only 
python scripts/emdb/run_eval.py --split 2 --input_dir "results/emdb"
```



## Training 
Sorry for the delay, but we may release an updated version.
